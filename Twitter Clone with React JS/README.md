# Twitter Clone with Reactjs

Hello, welcome to my first react project. 
to use this application, follow these steps. 
## Installation

 ```bash   
cd twitter-clone
```
> and then you have to install npm.
```
npm install
npm run start
```

and you need to create a firebase database. 
You can see the details in firebase.js about firebase database.
I recommend reading firebase docs to host and use realtime database for this project.

## Tech
- React JS
- Tailwind CSS
- Firebase Firestore
